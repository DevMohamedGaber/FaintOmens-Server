/* Saves Character Data in a SQLite database. We use SQLite for several reasons
//
// - SQLite is file based and works without having to setup a database server
//   - We can 'remove all ...' or 'modify all ...' easily via SQL queries
//   - A lot of people requested a SQL database and weren't comfortable with XML
//   - We can allow all kinds of character names, even chinese ones without
//     breaking the file system.
// - We will need MYSQL or similar when using multiple server instances later
//   and upgrading is trivial
// - XML is easier, but:
//   - we can't easily read 'just the class of a character' etc., but we need it
//     for character selection etc. often
//   - if each account is a folder that contains players, then we can't save
//     additional account info like password, banned, etc. unless we use an
//     additional account.xml file, which over-complicates everything
//   - there will always be forbidden file names like 'COM', which will cause
//     problems when people try to create accounts or characters with that name
//
// About item mall coins:
//   The payment provider's callback should add new orders to the
//   character_orders table. The server will then process them while the player
//   is ingame. Don't try to modify 'coins' in the character table directly.
//
// Tools to open sqlite database files:
//   Windows/OSX program: http://sqlitebrowser.org/
//   Firefox extension: https://addons.mozilla.org/de/firefox/addon/sqlite-manager/
//   Webhost: Adminer/PhpLiteAdmin
//
// About performance:
// - It's recommended to only keep the SQLite connection open while it's used.
//   MMO Servers use it all the time, so we keep it open all the time. This also
//   allows us to use transactions easily, and it will make the transition to
//   MYSQL easier.
// - Transactions are definitely necessary:
//   saving 100 players without transactions takes 3.6s
//   saving 100 players with transactions takes    0.38s
// - Using tr = conn.BeginTransaction() + tr.Commit() and passing it through all
//   the functions is ultra complicated. We use a BEGIN + END queries instead.
//
// Some benchmarks:
//   saving 100 players unoptimized: 4s
//   saving 100 players always open connection + transactions: 3.6s
//   saving 100 players always open connection + transactions + WAL: 3.6s
//   saving 100 players in 1 'using tr = ...' transaction: 380ms
//   saving 100 players in 1 BEGIN/END style transactions: 380ms
//   saving 100 players with XML: 369ms
//   saving 1000 players with mono-sqlite @ 2019-10-03: 843ms
//   saving 1000 players with sqlite-net  @ 2019-10-03:  90ms (!)
//
// Build notes:
// - requires Player settings to be set to '.NET' instead of '.NET Subset',
//   otherwise System.Data.dll causes ArgumentException.
// - requires sqlite3.dll x86 and x64 version for standalone (windows/mac/linux)
//   => found on sqlite.org website
// - requires libsqlite3.so x86 and armeabi-v7a for android
//   => compiled from sqlite.org amalgamation source with android ndk r9b linux
