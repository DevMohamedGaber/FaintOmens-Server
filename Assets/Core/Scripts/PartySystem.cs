/* there are different ways to implement a party system:
//
// - Player.cs can have a '[SyncVar] party' and broadcast it to all party members
//   when something changes in the party. there is no one source of truth, which
//   makes this a bit weird. it works, but only until we need a global party
//   list, e.g. for dungeon instances.
//
// - Player.cs can have a Party class reference that all members share. Mirror
//   can only serialize structs, which makes syncing more difficult then. There
//   is also the question of null vs. not null and we would have to not only
//   kick/leave parties, but also never forget to set .party to null. This
//   results in a lot of complicated code.
//
// - PartySystem could have a list of Party classes. But then the client would
//   need to have a local syncedParty class, which makes .party access on server
//   and client different (and hence very difficult).
//
// - PartySystem could control the parties. When anything is changed, it
//   automatically sets each member's '[SyncVar] party' which Mirror syncs
//   automatically. Server and client could access Player.party to read anything
//   and use PartySystem to modify parties.
//
//   => This seems to be the best solution for a party system with Mirror.
//   => PartySystem is almost independent from Unity. It's just a party system
//      with names and partyIds.
