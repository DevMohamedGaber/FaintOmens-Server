// UNET's current NetworkTransform is really laggy, so we make it smooth by
// simply synchronizing the agent's destination. We could also lerp between
// the transform positions, but this is much easier and saves lots of bandwidth.
//
// Using a NavMeshAgent also has the benefit that no rotation has to be synced
// while moving.
//
// Notes:
//
// - Teleportations have to be detected and synchronized properly
// - Caching the agent won't work because serialization sometimes happens
//   before awake/start
// - We also need the stopping distance, otherwise entities move too far.
